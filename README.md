# NewsMultiplatformDemo
A demo News app written with KMP

This project was created in order to check out KMP and be more familiar with it and some new libraries supporting it.
The client apps have two different screens, one for viewing the latest headlines about sports, and one for viewing some device details.

The shared Kotlin code features the levels from Datasources to ViewModel for sending the data to the clients and follows the Clean Architecture Guidelines.
